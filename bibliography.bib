abstract = {Raw lines of code (LOC) is a metric that does not, at first glance, seem extremely useful for automated test generation. It is both highly language-dependent and not extremely meaningful, semantically, within a language: one coder can produce the same effect with many fewer lines than another. However, relative LOC, between components of the same project, turns out to be a highly useful metric for automated testing. In this article, we make use of a heuristic based on LOC counts for tested functions to dramatically improve the effectiveness of automated test generation. This approach is particularly valuable in languages where collecting code coverage data to guide testing has a very high overhead. We apply the heuristic to property-based Python testing using the TSTL (Template Scripting Testing Language) tool. In our experiments, the simple LOC heuristic can improve branch and statement coverage by large margins (often more than 20%, up to 40% or more) and improve fault detection by an even larger margin (usually more than 75% and up to 400% or more). The LOC heuristic is also easy to combine with other approaches and is comparable to, and possibly more effective than, two well-established approaches for guiding random testing.},

abstract = {In recent years there has been an increasing interest in the art of computer programming,
the conceptual tools available for the design of programs, and the prevention of programming
oversights and error. The initial outstanding contribution to our understanding of
this subject was made by E. W. Dijkstra, whose Notes on Structured Programming form
the first and major section of this book. They clearly expound the reflections of
a brilliant programmer on the methods which he has hitherto unconsciously applied;
there can be no programmer of the present day who could not increase his skills by
a study and conscious application of these principles.In the second monograph I have
tried to describe how similar principles can be applied in the design of data structures.
I have suggested that in analysing a problem and groping towards a solution, a programmer
should take advantage of abstract concepts such as sets, sequences, and mappings;
and judiciously postpone decisions on representation until he is constructing the
more detailed code of the program. The monograph also describes a range of useful
ideas for data representation, and suggests the criteria relevant for their selection.The
third monograph provides a synthesis of the previous two, and expounds the close theoretical
and practical connections between the design of data and the design of programs. It
introduces useful additional methods for program and data structuring which may be
unfamiliar to many programmers. The examples show that structured programming principles
can be equally applied in "bottom-up" as in "top-down" program design. The original
inspiration, insight, and all the examples were contributed by O.-J. Dahl; I have
only assembled the material, and added some additional explanations where I found
it difficult to understand.}

abstract = {Everyone wants to know one thing about a test suite: will it detect enough bugs? Unfortunately, in most settings that matter, answering this question directly is impractical or impossible. Software engineers and researchers therefore tend to rely on various measures of code coverage (where mutation testing is considered a form of syntactic coverage). A long line of academic research efforts have attempted to determine whether relying on coverage as a substitute for fault detection is a reasonable solution to the problems of test suite evaluation. This essay argues that the profusion of coverage-related literature is in part a sign of an underlying uncertainty as to what exactly it is that measuring coverage should achieve, as well as how we would know if it can, in fact, achieve it. We propose some solutions and mitigations, but the primary focus of this essay is to clarify the state of current confusions regarding this key problem for effective software testing.},

abstract = {There has been a lot of work to shed light on whether random testing is actually a useful testing technique. Despite its simplicity, several successful real-world applications appear in the literature. Although it is not going to solve all possible testing problems, random testing is an essential tool in the hands of software testers. In this paper, we address general questions about random testing, such as how long random testing needs on average to achieve testing targets (e.g., coverage), how does it scale and how likely is it to yield similar results if we re-run random testing on the same testing problem. Due to its simplicity that makes the mathematical analysis of random testing tractable, we provide precise and rigorous answers to these questions. Our formal results can be applied to most types of software and testing criteria. Simulations are carried out to provide further support to our formal results. The obtained results are then used to assess the validity of empirical analyses reported in the literature. Results show that random testing is more effective and predictable than previously thought.},
