\section{The Dialogue}

The dialogue takes place in a classroom.  The last class of the day has finished, and the professor is packing up his laptop and turning off the projection screen, as a few students remain sitting near each other.  The lingering students have become interested in a {\bf PROBLEM} (or perhaps simply caught up in an argument).

\vspace{0.1in}

\emph{(let's listen in)}

\vspace{0.1in}

\noindent {\bf PUPIL SIGMA:}  It just seems trivial to me.  I think the code here is simple enough that you can simply inspect it and see that it does what it should do.  The idea of binary search is slightly tricky to understand the very first time you see it, but once you understand how it works, writing code to ``do it'' does not require a PhD.

\vspace{0.1in}

\noindent {\bf PUPIL BETA:}  I'm not claiming it takes a PhD, or saying a PhD would help!  You saw how Dr. Omega messed it up the first time on the whiteboard.

\vspace{0.1in}

\noindent{\bf PUPIL DELTA:} \emph{(sotto voce)} That's because Dr. Omega is a bit of an absentminded flake.


\section{Postscript}

This dialogue is a tribute to and reflection on Imre Lakatos' classic work, \emph{Proof and Refutation}~\cite{lakatos1963proofs}.  It also owes a debt to MacKenzie's more recent classic, \emph{Mechanizing Proof: Computing, Risk, and Trust}~\cite{mackenzie2004mechanizing}
